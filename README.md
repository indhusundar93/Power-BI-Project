# Power-BI-Project
This Power BI project analyzes global COVID-19 data to study confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Data was cleaned using Power Query and key metrics were calculated using DAX. Interactive dashboards provide country-wise and region-wise insights through charts and maps.
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic across different countries and WHO regions. The dataset includes confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases, active cases, and new cases, which were cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor to ensure accuracy and consistency 

Covid-19 Dataset

Calculated columns such as Recovery Percentage and Case Status were created to enhance analysis. DAX measures were implemented to calculate key metrics like Total Confirmed Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered Cases, Death Rate, and Top 10 Countries by Confirmed Cases. These measures allow dynamic and interactive analysis based on filters and slicers.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive visual overview using bar charts, line charts, pie charts, KPI cards, maps, and key influencer visuals. WHO region-wise analysis highlights differences in COVID-19 impact, showing higher case concentrations in regions like the Americas and Europe. The map visualization helps identify global hotspots, while the Key Influencers visual explains factors affecting confirmed cases.

Overall, this project demonstrates effective use of Power BI, DAX, and data visualization techniques to convert raw COVID-19 data into meaningful insights. The analysis supports better understanding of pandemic trends and showcases how data analytics can aid decision-making in public health scenarios.
